# Welcome

This is an example of static web page generated by Hugo.
No big knowledge of `html`, Hugo comes with features ready to be used, even
augmented by themes. For instance this theme has nice feature for project
documentation, included but not restricted to:

- keyword search box in the top-left corner.
- content folder structure corresponding to the left expandable navigation
menu.
- the code is highlighted.

<div class="notices tip">
<p>Try the search box in the top-left corner and look for <i>ggplot2</i>.</p>
</div>

The user simply edits the `content` folder with markdown files, adds 
figures, docs, or other elements in the `static folder and run the
command `hugo` to render the webpage in the `public` folder.
Nicely, with the following comment the website is dynamically rendered
at <http://localhost:1313/> and modifications of the source are automatically
rendered.

```
hugo server
```
