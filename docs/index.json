	"content": "2021-03-11, FCA Collin\nTidyverse, Not a Golden Hammer The Law of the instrument describes a cognitive bias:\n “I call it the law of the instrument, and it may be formulated as follows: Give a small boy a hammer, and he will find that everything he encounters needs pounding.” (Abraham Kaplan, 1964)\n It was identified as an AntiPattern, a programming practice to be avoided (William Brown et al, 1998). One of the pit fall is expressed as:\n “the tendency of jobs to be adapted to tools, rather than adapting tools to jobs” (Silvan Tomkins, 1963).\n The tidyverse package helps end-user in R-coding delimited statistic tasks. It is a very good idea to use it if your purpose is to walk through an analysis from a point A (the dataset) to the point B (the result) for procedures of limited complexity. Indeed, with a limited number of human-readable functions you can get the expected result while helping the future reader to follow the procedure. However, as soon as you want to resolve statistical problems in a more systemic way, by creating functions that will help you to get your result in a more concise (because accurate) code and tested for and documented and robust, tidyverse is not the most suitable choice.\nThe package vignette itself enclose a clear disclaimer about the package rational:\n “the biggest difference is in priorities: base R is highly focussed on stability, whereas the tidyverse will make breaking changes in the search for better interfaces.” Welcome to the Tidyverse vignette, 2019\n The trade-off between stability and interface evolution is also acknowledged:\n Do you expect the tidyverse to be the part of core R packages some day?\nHadley Wickham: “It’s extremely unlikely because the core packages are extremely conservative so that base R code is stable, and backward compatible. I prefer to have a more utopian approach where I can be quite aggressive about making backward incompatible changes while trying to figure out a better API.” quora\n There is no doubt that tidyverse is a set of high quality tools, but it is designed to serve some purpose: easy and highly readable code at the cost of stability which is a strategy which can’t serve all developments. Besides, the over reliance of craftsperson on a known tool, brings to see the challenge not as it is but how it fit to the tool. As a matter of fact, an over reliance on tidyverse risk to introduce a cognitive bias, increasing the risk of of deviation from initial target as fitting your purpose to the problem instead of making the method suitable to answer specific question. The over-reliance can be evidence by a large tidyverse block which have obviously lost the main sells argument of the package: readability.\nIn order to increase the range of possible ways to address a question, so as to minimise the risk of programming cognitive bias, it is good to demonstrate alternatives to the tidyverse approach put in some context, and present the R base alternative. There will be a trade-off switching from one to the other about readability, performance and code stability. But, maybe, this will also help thinking about different approaches to address statistical problems.\nFilter and Select library(tidyverse)  Tidyerse Non-Standard Evaluation:\niris %\u0026gt;% filter(Species == \u0026quot;setosa\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% select(Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length) %\u0026gt;% head ## Sepal.Width Sepal.Length ## 1 3.5 5.1 ## 2 3.0 4.9 ## 3 3.2 4.7 ## 4 3.1 4.6 ## 5 3.6 5.0 ## 6 3.9 5.4  Base Non-Standard Evaluation:\nsel \u0026lt;- subset( iris, subset = Species == \u0026quot;setosa\u0026quot;, select = c(Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length) ) head(sel) ## Sepal.Width Sepal.Length ## 1 3.5 5.1 ## 2 3.0 4.9 ## 3 3.2 4.7 ## 4 3.1 4.6 ## 5 3.6 5.0 ## 6 3.9 5.4  Base data.frame accessors:\nsel \u0026lt;- iris[ iris$Species == \u0026quot;setosa\u0026quot;, c(\u0026quot;Sepal.Width\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Sepal.Length\u0026quot;) ] head(sel) ## Sepal.Width Sepal.Length ## 1 3.5 5.1 ## 2 3.0 4.9 ## 3 3.2 4.7 ## 4 3.1 4.6 ## 5 3.6 5.0 ## 6 3.9 5.4  Mutate df[df$age \u0026gt; 90, ] \u0026lt;- NA sessionInfo() ## R version 4.0.4 (2021-02-15) ## Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) ## Running under: Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster) ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas/libblas.so.3 ## LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libopenblasp-r0.3.5.so ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_CTYPE=en_GB.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [3] LC_TIME=en_GB.UTF-8 LC_COLLATE=en_GB.UTF-8 ## [5] LC_MONETARY=en_GB.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=en_GB.UTF-8 ## [7] LC_PAPER=en_GB.UTF-8 LC_NAME=C ## [9] LC_ADDRESS=C LC_TELEPHONE=C ## [11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_GB.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] forcats_0.5.1 stringr_1.4.0 dplyr_1.0.5 purrr_0.3.4 ## [5] readr_1.4.0 tidyr_1.1.3 tibble_3.1.0 ggplot2_3.3.3 ## [9] tidyverse_1.3.0 ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] tidyselect_1.1.0 xfun_0.22 haven_2.3.1 colorspace_2.0-0 ## [5] vctrs_0.3.6 generics_0.1.0 htmltools_0.5.1.1 yaml_2.2.1 ## [9] utf8_1.2.1 rlang_0.4.10 pillar_1.5.1 withr_2.4.1 ## [13] glue_1.4.2 DBI_1.1.1 dbplyr_2.0.0 modelr_0.1.8 ## [17] readxl_1.3.1 lifecycle_1.0.0 munsell_0.5.0 gtable_0.3.0 ## [21] cellranger_1.1.0 rvest_1.0.0 evaluate_0.14 knitr_1.31 ## [25] ps_1.6.0 fansi_0.4.2 broom_0.7.5 Rcpp_1.0.6 ## [29] scales_1.1.1 backports_1.2.1 jsonlite_1.7.2 fs_1.5.0 ## [33] hms_1.0.0 digest_0.6.27 stringi_1.5.3 grid_4.0.4 ## [37] cli_2.3.1 tools_4.0.4 magrittr_2.0.1 crayon_1.4.1 ## [41] pkgconfig_2.0.3 ellipsis_0.3.1 xml2_1.3.2 reprex_1.0.0 ## [45] lubridate_1.7.10 assertthat_0.2.1 rmarkdown_2.6 httr_1.4.2 ## [49] rstudioapi_0.13 R6_2.5.0 compiler_4.0.4 "

	"content": "2021-01-11, FCA Collin (update 2021-01-12)\nPresentation The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) is a general representation of a binary classifier; it accounts for:\n the sensitivity (the proportion of real positive case detected), the false positive rate (1 - sensitivity), the general performance via the area under the ROC curve (AUC).  The classifier for the example identifies tumour tissues (yes/no) in the case of lung cancer (LC) or eventually identifies the Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) histological subtype. The dataset used for the graphic requires at least columns for the sensitivity, the false-positive rate and a decision rule represented by a threshold proportion, in that case varying from 0 to 1. Additionally, information about the classifier itself can include the model identification (LC, SCC), as well as the AUC (+ confidence interval estimation) as a overall evaluation of the models.\nData Lets dtaplot being as example dataset such as:\n First row of the dataset behind the ROC curves.

Sens. 90%: has its better not to miss true positive patients, the threshold may be determined so as to catch 90% of true positive patient (sensibility), eventually at a cost in terms of overall error as it then automatically increase the false-alarm rate.  Lets threshold being the supplementary data characterising this two decision rules:\n`Threshold, the decision rules.

Points can identify this threshold and performance on the ROC curve.\n{ ggplot( data = dtaplot, mapping = aes( x = FalseAlarm, y = Sensitivity, ymax = Sensitivity, fill = Diag, color = Diag ) ) + geom_ribbon( ymin = 0, alpha = .5, color = NA ) + geom_line( lwd = 1 ) + geom_abline( slope = 1, intercept = 0, col = \u0026quot;gray50\u0026quot;, lwd = 2, lty = 2 ) + xlab( \u0026quot;False Alarm Rate (1 - specificity)\u0026quot; ) + facet_grid( . ~ Diag ) + theme( asp = 1 ) + geom_point( data = threshold, mapping = aes(shape = Rational, colour = Rational), size = 3 ) }  The plot can be further personalised manipulating the theme locally to address for instance the positioning of the legend and other settings.\n{ ggplot( data = dtaplot, mapping = aes( x = FalseAlarm, y = Sensitivity, ymax = Sensitivity, fill = Diag, color = Diag ) ) + geom_ribbon( ymin = 0, alpha = .5, color = NA ) + geom_line( lwd = 1 ) + geom_abline( slope = 1, intercept = 0, col = \u0026quot;gray50\u0026quot;, lwd = 2, lty = 2 ) + xlab( \u0026quot;False Alarm Rate (1 - specificity)\u0026quot; ) + facet_grid( . ~ Diag ) + geom_point( data = threshold, mapping = aes(shape = Rational, colour = Rational), size = 3 ) + theme( asp = 1, legend.position = \u0026quot;bottom\u0026quot;, legend.text = element_text(size = 8), legend.title = element_text(size = 8), legend.background = element_rect(fill = \u0026quot;transparent\u0026quot;), plot.background = element_rect(fill = alpha(\u0026quot;white\u0026quot;, .5), colour = 'white') ) }  Final Finally, as a last piece of annotation, the AUC given with its confidence interval may help for further comparison.\n{ ggplot( data = dtaplot, mapping = aes( x = FalseAlarm, y = Sensitivity, ymax = Sensitivity, fill = Diag, color = Diag ) ) + geom_ribbon( ymin = 0, alpha = .5, color = NA ) + geom_line( lwd = 1 ) + geom_abline( slope = 1, intercept = 0, col = \u0026quot;gray50\u0026quot;, lwd = 2, lty = 2 ) + xlab( \u0026quot;False Alarm Rate (1 - specificity)\u0026quot; ) + facet_grid( . ~ Diag ) + geom_point( data = threshold, mapping = aes(shape = Rational, colour = Rational), size = 3 ) + theme( asp = 1, legend.position = \u0026quot;bottom\u0026quot;, legend.text = element_text(size = 8), legend.title = element_text(size = 8), legend.background = element_rect(fill = \u0026quot;transparent\u0026quot;), plot.background = element_rect(fill = alpha(\u0026quot;white\u0026quot;, .5), colour = 'white') ) + geom_label( data = aggregate(auc.ci ~ Diag + ntree, data = dtaplot, unique), mapping = aes(label = auc.ci, ymax = NULL, fill = NULL, color = NULL , x = .5, y = .5 ) ) }  sessionInfo() ## R version 4.0.3 (2020-10-10) ## Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) ## Running under: Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster) ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas/libblas.so.3 ## LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libopenblasp-r0.3.5.so ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_CTYPE=en_GB.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [3] LC_TIME=en_GB.UTF-8 LC_COLLATE=en_GB.UTF-8 ## [5] LC_MONETARY=en_GB.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=en_GB.UTF-8 ## [7] LC_PAPER=en_GB.UTF-8 LC_NAME=C ## [9] LC_ADDRESS=C LC_TELEPHONE=C ## [11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_GB.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] ggthemr_1.1.0 ggplot2_3.3.2 ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] knitr_1.29 magrittr_1.5 tidyselect_1.1.0 munsell_0.5.0 ## [5] colorspace_1.4-1 R6_2.4.1 rlang_0.4.7 dplyr_1.0.2 ## [9] stringr_1.4.0 highr_0.8 tools_4.0.3 grid_4.0.3 ## [13] gtable_0.3.0 xfun_0.16 withr_2.2.0 htmltools_0.5.0 ## [17] ellipsis_0.3.1 yaml_2.2.1 digest_0.6.25 tibble_3.0.3 ## [21] lifecycle_0.2.0 crayon_1.3.4 farver_2.0.3 purrr_0.3.4 ## [25] vctrs_0.3.4 glue_1.4.2 evaluate_0.14 rmarkdown_2.3 ## [29] labeling_0.3 stringi_1.4.6 compiler_4.0.3 pillar_1.4.6 ## [33] generics_0.0.2 scales_1.1.1 pkgconfig_2.0.3 "
